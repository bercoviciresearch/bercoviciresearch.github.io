![a picture of Dan]({{site.baseurl}}/images/DrB.png)

Dan is a Lecturer of Chemistry at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo.  He has been at Cal Poly since 2015.  He received his B.Sc. from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2004, and his Ph.D. from the University of Vermont in 2013 in the research group of [Prof. Matthias Brewer](https://www.uvm.edu/cas/chemistry/profiles/matthias-brewer).  In between his undergaduate and doctoral studies, Dan worked for two different start-up companies focusing on a wide vairety of polymer applications; from stimuli-responsive drug delivery systems to cosmetics. 

### Research Interests
Research in the Bercovici Research group generally focuses on useful small molecule synthesis.  We are a traditional synthetic organic research group that develops new synthetic reactions and applies them to useful systems.  Specifially we have two resarch projects: 1) The Development of Nucleophile-Induced retro-Diels-Alder Linkages for Polymer Systems, and 2) A Novel Hydroboration-Oxidation of Ynamides. We also utilize computational chemistry to analyze our experimental systems in much of our research.
